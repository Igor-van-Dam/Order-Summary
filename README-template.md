## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

1. The use of <main>
2. Recaped and learned CSS properties such as:

- background-image: url('./images/pattern-background-desktop.svg')
- background-size: contain;
- background-repeat: no-repeat;
- box-shadow: 0 3px 15px
- font-weight
- position: absolute
- position: relative
- button customizing
- :hover
- :active
- media queries i.e.


### Continued development

- media queries i.e. @media: I'm still not comfortable with this.

### Useful resources

- frontendmentor.slack (https://app.slack.com/client/TCYEB44S2/CCYHFT85B) - This helped me. I really liked that you could share your issue, ask about it or simply browse and find a solution.
